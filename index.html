        <h3>At the mercy of motivation</h3>
        <p>written: 26th April 2022</p>
        <p>It's difficult to be consistent and if it's not, I clearly haven't grasped the skill yet</p>
        <p>There are random days when a spark finds me and I get the bare minimum work done, but that's no way to live, at the mercy of motivation, just drifting through the stream of time</p>
        <p>Find your why, they say, easier said than done</p>
        <p>Oh the misery</p>
        <p>Forget everything you assumed about living, both what others around you do and tell you to do and the assumptions you've made yourself. It's time to wipe the slate clean and start from scratch, the hard job of inventing the universe first has already been done for you
